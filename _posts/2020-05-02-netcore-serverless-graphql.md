# Workshop Content

## GraphQL API

This first part covers GraphQL. You will be taught to define a schema in gql and learn concepts such `query`, `mutation`, `resolvers`. We will learn both how to read and write data and how to resolve nested queries

## Microservices

In this part, we will learn how to build a Microservice in .NET Core and C#. We will also learn how to containerize our services and how to get them up and running with `Docker` and `docker-compose`.

## Serverless

In this part, we will learn how to serve our GraphQL API from within a Serverless function.

## Deployment

Here we will learn to lift everything to the Cloud. We will push our microservices to a so-called Azure Container Registry, a private container repo in the Cloud and from there create endpoints in the Cloud.

We will also learn how to deploy the Serverless function to the Cloud
